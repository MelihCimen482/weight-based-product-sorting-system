# Weight-Based Sorting System

## Project Overview
This project is an industrial automation system designed to sort products based on their weight.
Products are classified into different categories according to predefined weight ranges.

## System Scenario
Products move on a conveyor belt and are measured using a weight sensor.
The PLC reads the weight value and determines the correct sorting path.
According to the decision, the system activates the appropriate actuator to direct the product.

## Technologies Used
- PLC (TIA Portal)
- Factory I/O (Simulation)
